# Accounting Class Projection Application
a excercise and proof-of-concept of a windows application(WPF using C#) that determines what grade my classmates must receive on their final exam to get either an A, B, or C in the class. My professor had introduced us a similar tool in an Excel spreadsheet, but found it counter-productive to have to load the whole Excel application to solve such a simple problem. 

## Technology
This was one of my first non-web, fully-executed programs I have written. I used the C# language, along with the Windows Presentation Foundation to develop the interface to compute what grade my classmates need to get a specific letter grade.

## Related project
This project inspired me to create a web-based application so my classmates wouldn't have to download an .exe*that was either being recognized as virus or doesn't run on MacOS). They could rather just go to a webpage to determine their grade, regardless of their operating system or device. I then created [C.P.J.](https://github.com/BenKincaid-Web/CPJ), which is mobile responsive and fully functional on all major browsers. Check out repository for more information.
